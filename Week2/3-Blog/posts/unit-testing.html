            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p class="content">You have an amazing backend project idea, and you start coding. After each API implementation, you test it using Swagger, and everything works perfectly. However, once deployed, some users report unexpected issues. How could this happen? You tested it multiple times, right?</p>
            
            <p class="content">Manual testing with Swagger is practical but has limitations. This is where Unit Testing comes to the rescue! But what exactly is unit testing, how is it implemented, and why is it essential? Letâ€™s explore these questions together and see how unit testing is applied in .NET.</p>
        
            <h2>What is Unit Testing?</h2>
            <p class="content">Unit testing is the process of testing the smallest unit of code, such as methods or functions, independently. The goal is to isolate the code, test specific conditions, and easily identify errors when they occur.</p>
            
            <pre class="code-block"><code>
public class MathFormulas {
    public bool IsEven(int number) => number % 2 == 0;
    public int Add(int x, int y) => x + y;
}
            </code></pre>
        
        <h2>Why Unit Testing?</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Isolates Code:</strong> Allows testing a function independently, making it easier to identify issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitates Refactoring:</strong> Ensures changes in the code do not break existing functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Helps Debugging:</strong> Pinpoints exactly where the problem occurs.</li>
            <li><strong>Speeds Up Development:</strong> Eliminates repetitive manual testing.</li>
        </ul>
        
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="content">Unit testing is an essential part of software development. Writing tests ensures reliability, maintainability, and faster debugging. Using frameworks like xUnit.net, MSTest, and NUnit, you can implement robust test automation.</p>
